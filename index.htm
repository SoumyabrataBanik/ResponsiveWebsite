            <p class="text-small">Education is the process of acquiring knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes that enable individuals to participate in society and contribute to its development. Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and can be delivered through various methods such as instruction, discussion, experimentation, or observation. Education can have different goals, such as literacy, numeracy, critical thinking, creativity, or civic engagement. Education is considered a human right and a public good, as it benefits not only the individual learners but also the society as a whole. Education can also foster personal growth, social inclusion, cultural diversity, and global citizenship.</p>

            <p class="text-small">Transforming education in India is a crucial and challenging task that requires collective efforts from the government, educators, parents, students, and society. Some of the key aspects of transforming education in India are:
            Implementing the National Education Policy 2020, which aims to make education more equitable, inclusive, and high-quality, with a focus on early childhood care and education, multilingualism, competency-based assessment, and holistic development.
            Improving access and quality of education for all, especially for the marginalized and disadvantaged groups, by ensuring adequate infrastructure, resources, teachers, curriculum, and technology.
            Reducing disparities and dropouts, increasing enrolment and completion rates, enhancing learning outcomes and employability, by providing relevant, engaging, and personalized learning opportunities for every learner</p>

            <p class="text-big">Let's Grow Together!</p>
            <p class="text-small">“Let’s grow together with education” is a slogan that expresses the idea that education is not only a personal benefit, but also a social good. Education can help individuals to develop their potential, acquire new skills, and pursue their interests. Education can also help society to progress, innovate, and solve problems. Education can foster a culture of learning, collaboration, and diversity, where people can share their knowledge, ideas, and perspectives. Education can also promote values such as respect, tolerance, and responsibility, where people can coexist peacefully and harmoniously. Therefore, education is not only a means of personal growth, but also a way of collective development.</p>
